This test document focuses on verifying the core functionalities of the application that are crucial for user interaction and navigation. These include modules that are present in almost every modern web or mobile application, such as:

Login Page

Signup Page

Forgot Password

Home Screen

Profile Page

Sort & Filters

Logout Functionality

Each feature was tested through multiple test scenarios, including both positive test cases (valid inputs and expected workflows) and negative test cases (invalid inputs, blank fields, incorrect actions). This ensures comprehensive coverage and helps identify any validation issues, broken flows, or missing error handling.

ðŸ§ª Features Tested:
Login Page
Verified authentication with correct and incorrect credentials, blank submissions, and handling of unregistered users.

Signup Page
Checked user registration with valid details, password mismatches, existing emails, and form validation for empty fields.

Forgot Password
Tested reset flow using registered and unregistered emails, link expiration, and field validation.

Home Screen
Ensured visibility of homepage after login, prevented unauthorized access, and verified UI elements.

Profile Page
Tested data retrieval, profile editing, validation for required fields, and profile image upload.

Sort & Filters
Verified sorting options, single/multiple filter combinations, and clearing filter actions.

Logout Functionality
Ensured user is logged out securely, session is cleared, and back navigation is restricted after logout.

ðŸ’» Test Environment:
Device: ASUS Laptop

Operating System: Windows 11

RAM/Storage: 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD

Browser Used: Google Chrome (latest version)

Screen Resolution: 1920x1080

âœ… Objective:
The objective of these test cases is to confirm that all general functionalities of the application are working as intended across standard user environments. This testing ensures a smooth user experience and identifies any defects in key workflows early in the development cycle.

All test results are documented with expected outputs and pass/fail status to support quality assurance, debugging, and future automation.
